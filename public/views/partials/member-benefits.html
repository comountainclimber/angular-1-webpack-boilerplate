      <h2>The Aircraft</h2>
      <p flex-sm="80" flex-xs="75" class="margin-auto">
        FreshAir utilizes 7-seat aircraft (turboprops or light jets) for the majority of its flights. We occasionally bump up to midsize and heavy jets during peak demand. We always fly with two seasoned mountain pilots.
